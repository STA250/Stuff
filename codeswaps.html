    <p>As per the syllabus, every assignment will be followed by a <em>code swap</em> or <em>code review</em>. Each student will be assigned to review the homework code of another student in the class. All homework solution code must be uploaded to GitHub within 24 hours of the homework due date. You should upload your code as you ran it for the assigment, do not modify or make it more readable after the fact.</p> 
    <p>After everyone has uploaded their code, you will then be assigned the GitHub username of a fellow student (randomized) and can then view their homework code by going to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> and finding their homework repo. Randomized student assignments are available from the links below.</p>
	<p>The code review is due exactly 1 week after the homework assignment is due.</p>
	<p>Code reviews should be at most one page (often less), turned in during class.</p>
	<p>The should follow the basic outline below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Brief description of what the code does (e.g., <em>This code implements both a Metropolis-Hastings and a Metropolis-within-Gibbs MCMC sampler for Bayesian logistic regression. Additional options include sampling of arbitrary blocks of components and standardization of input covariates etc....</em>)</li>
		<li>Readability: Comment on the readibility of the code. Was it well commented? Was is it well structured? Could you understand it? Provide a score out of 10 for readability.</li>
		<li>Elegance: Comment on the elegance of the code. Was it efficient? Is it extensible/reusable or problem-specific? Provide a score out of 10 for elegance.</li>
		<li>Kudos: Comment on any things done particularly well in the code, or ideas/new tricks you learned from reading the code.</li>
		<li>Advice: Provide any advice that could help the coder improve their solution code.</li>
	</ul>
